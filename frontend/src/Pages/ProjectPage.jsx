        <p className="text-justify text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The institutional capacity of Gram Panchayats (GPs) across India has
          long been a challenge despite multiple interventions through programs
          like BRGF, RGPSA, and RGSA. These programs have highlighted the need
          for focused efforts to empower GPs, enabling them to address
          development challenges effectively. Quality GPDP preparation remains a
          significant gap, limiting the impact of rural development initiatives.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-4">
          The project for <b>"Creating 250 Model GP Clusters"</b> is a response
          to these challenges. By developing models that showcase good
          governance, sustainability, and innovative practices, the project aims
          to inspire replication across India's vast network of GPs. The
          rationale focuses on enhancing institutional capacity while fostering
          localized solutions aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

        <p className="text-justify text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) launched this project under the
          Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) to address critical governance
          challenges at the grassroots level. Covering 250 clusters of Gram
          Panchayats across 28 states and 3 union territories, the project
          provides professional mentoring, technical handholding, and
          institutional support to enable GPs to serve as sustainable models.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-4">
          Initially scheduled for 2020â€“22, the project's implementation was
          delayed due to COVID-19 and later extended to 2026. This extension
          allows for continued guidance and refinement of thematic GPDPs, with a
          focus on holistic development and inclusive governance.
